# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Course**: SIS-2203 - Machine Learning Final Project  
**Semester**: Fall 2025  
**Team**: SIS-2203  

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict loan approval decisions, achieving **98.5% accuracy** with proper validation techniques. We identified and resolved critical data leakage issues, implemented robust cross-validation, and created interpretable models suitable for business deployment.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Fixed data leakage issues (removed 'points' feature with 0.82 target correlation)
- ✅ Implemented proper train/test split and 5-fold cross-validation  
- ✅ Reduced feature dimensionality from 1,000+ to 7 meaningful features
- ✅ Achieved realistic performance: 98.3% F1-score with Random Forest
- ✅ Delivered interpretable models with clear feature importance rankings

- **Target**: Binary classification (Approved/Rejected)
- **Key Finding**: Identified data leakage in 'points' feature (0.82 correlation)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Leakage Removal**: Eliminated 'points' feature and applicant names
- **Feature Engineering**: Smart city encoding, financial ratios, employment stability
- **Train/Test Split**: 80%/20% with stratified sampling

### 3. Model Development
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
