##  Quick Start

1. Open in Colab (no local setup required):  
   [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tenmongit/loan-approval-project-mlfinal/blob/main/notebooks/01.ipynb)

2. Run notebooks sequentially:  
   **01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05**  
   (each notebook depends on outputs from the previous one)

3. Final evaluation metrics are stored in:  
   `reports/metrics.json`
